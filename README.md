### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexandre, and I'm glad to present you my side projects :smiley_cat:

## [physic-schem](https://alexfauquette.github.io/physic-shem/)

This web app allows you to draw simple electric schemas, and export them as png or [circuitikz](https://github.com/circuitikz/circuitikz) code that can directly be copy past in your LaTeX document. It comes with an introduction on how to use circuitikz.

This project is made with ReactJS, Redux, Material-UI, and some other lovely libraries. The documentation is not ready yet, but please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any question or comment.

## [joke-simulation](https://https://alexfauquette.github.io/joke-simulation/)

The small one, allows you to perform simulations on fluid dynamics directly in your web browser. This project relies on [FreeFem++-js](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/lehyaric/ffjs/), a Javascript version of [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/). The FreeFem++ code is provided by [Thomas Rey](https://thomasrey.wordpress.com/).

## [OpenFoodFact HungerGames](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-hungergames)

OpenFoodFact maintain a collaborative and open database of food products (the Wikipedia of food). Extracting informations from food packaging is a boring task. So we try to provide a better user experience.
